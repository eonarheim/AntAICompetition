\section{Ants! Ants! Ants!}


Inspired by the Google AI Challenge, we present the Ant AI challenge. The idea is simple: two ant generals command an ant army, trying to capture the enemey base. Contestants will submit an agent program that commands their army.

\section{The Board}

The board consists of five pieces

	\end{center}

\subsection{Ants}
A player will randomly be assigned a team color: blue or red. Ants may move LEFT, RIGHT, UP or DOWN.

\subsection{Hills}
The pink squares are the hills, where new ants will spawn. Moving one of your ants on top of the opponent's hill will result in victory.

\subsection{Food}
The green squares are food, picking up a piece of food will create a new ant on your hill. If any ant is currently on your hill when you pick up a piece of food, the new ant will not spawn.Up to four new food may be spawned every turn.

\subsection{Wall}
No ants may move here, nor may food spawn here.

\subsection{Open Spaces}
Any ant may try to claim an open space. The map does not wrap around (i.e. an ant moving right at the rightmost boundary will not appear at the leftmost boundary)

\newpage
\section{Moving}
Moves may only take a maximum of TWO SECONDS to compute. If the agent does not send a move within the timefrace, no move is made.
\subsection{Basic Moves}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{basicMove.png}
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
  \item An ant may move LEFT, RIGHT, UP or DOWN. No diagonal moves are allowed
  \item You may not move on top of a wall
  \item The map does not wrap around (i.e. an ant moving right at the rightmost boundary will not appear at the leftmost boundary)
  \item An invalid move will result in no move
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Interacting With Other Ants}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{fight.png}
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Moving onto an enemy ant results in the destruction of both ants
  \item If two ants swap positions, (red moves right and blue moves left) both are destroyed
  \item Two ants on the same team may not destroy each other
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Moving On To Food}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{foodGrab.png}
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Grabbing food will create a new ant on your hill
  \item If any ant is currently on your hill when you pick up a piece of food, the new ant will not spawn
  \item If two ants move on to the same piece of food, both ants are destroyed. No new ant will spawn
  \item If two foods are grabbed at the same time, by the same player, only one new ant is gained
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Capturing the Hill}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{hillCapture.png}
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Moving your ant on top of the enemy hill wins the game
  \item If an ant of the hill being captured occupies the hill, both ants are destroyed, but the hill lives. 
\end{itemize}


\newpage
\section{Winning}
There are three ways to win a game of Ants
\begin{itemize}
  \item Destroying the opponent ant hill
  \item If both ant hills are destroyed at the same time, the player with the most ants wins
  \item If time expires on the game, the player with the most ants wins
\end{itemize}

\section{Controlling Your Army}
\subsection{Provided Clients}
We have provided base clients for .NET, Python and Node.js. An agent may be created by inheriting AgentBase. The only public methods are Update and a constructor. Web service calls and connection to the server are handled by the base class.
\newline
\newline
\href{https://github.com/eonarheim/AntAICompetition}{Link to clients}

\subsection{API}
If you are interested in writing your own client in Haskell, PL/SQL or any other language, feel free to use our well-documented \href{https://github.com/eonarheim/AntAICompetition}{API}

\section{Testing Your Submission}

By way of proper API calls or inheriting from the base agents, a new, observable game will be created at \url{https://github.com/eonarheim/AntAICompetition}.
\newline
\newline
When the start() method is called, a new game against a dummy agent will be started. 

\section{Submissions}
A valid submission will include the following
\begin{itemize}
  \item Binaries and source code for working client
  \item Binaries should run on a 64-bit Windows Machine
  \item Compilation instructions if necessary
\end{itemize}


\noindent All final submissions should be placed in //genmills/corporate/public/codecamp/antai/YOURNAME
\newline
\newline

\noindent An entry may be disqualified for the following reasons
\begin{itemize}
  \item Writing to the file system
  \item Hacking into the game server in any way
\end{itemize}
